    <h3 class="nameAbout">Tommy Veen</h3>
    <p class="meText"> I was born and raised in Amsterdam (1994) and also lived in Leiden for a while. Before my 15th birthday I
      moved back to Amsterdam to finish high-school at the 'Amsterdams Lyceum'.
      After school, I studied 'Business Adminstration' for two years, just to realise I wanted to move on and do something
      I really love. I want(ed) to become a Full-Stack Webdeveloper and create stunning, professional websites. </p>
